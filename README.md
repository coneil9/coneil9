# **Hi there!👋 I'm Carter.** 

I am a second-year student studying Business and Computer Science (BUCS) at the University of British Columbia. I’m deeply interested in AI agents, automated systems, and building useful projects that have a real impact. Right now, I’m learning how to build full-stack applications with scalable databases, focusing on taking ideas from concept to real customers in production.
